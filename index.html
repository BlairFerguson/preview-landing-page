      <h2>What is Preview?</h2>
      <p>
        Preview Diagnostics is a Singapore-based healthtech company leveraging AI and retinal imaging to diagnose
        systemic, chronic conditions early — often before symptoms even arise. Our proprietary deep learning model
        integrates directly into existing clinical workflows, helping clinicians detect disease earlier without
        extra training or equipment.

      <h2>Why Preview?</h2>
      <p>
        Chronic disease is the leading cause of death globally, yet prevention is vastly underfunded. Preview is
        changing that by turning routine eye scans into powerful early detection tools. Earlier diagnosis means
        better outcomes, lower costs, and peace of mind — for patients, providers, insurers, and researchers alike.
